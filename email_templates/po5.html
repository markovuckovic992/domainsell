	Hi {{item.name}},
	<br /><br />
	I hope you found my previous emails helpful. I just wanted to let you know that your brand new domain is going to be ready for you soon.   	
	<br /><br />
	Have you decided how you are going to use your new domain? Here’s a few useful tips to help you get the most out of your new domain name. 
	<br /><br />
	<b>-<u>Start a new blog</u></b>. Did you know companies with a blog attract 55% more visitors? A blog is a great way to tell your audience what you are doing. 
	<br />
	You can also talk about your offers. Fill it with engaging contents and <b><u>insert link to your site</u></b> (and other sites too)
	<br /><br />
	<b>-</b>You can use the new domain to <b><u>host a new site</u></b>. This does not mean you have to scrap the existing one. Fill it with new contents. Again use links to your existing site.
	<br /><br />
	<b>-<u>Forward your new domain</u> >>> to your current Website/Blog/Facebook/Twitter</b>. If you think you do not have time for the above options, then this a great way to get started. Forwarding does not hold much juice for SEO but is good for branding. 
	<br />Anyone who says Google does not like forwarding, ask them to go to gooogle.com (typo domain with three ‘o’s) and they’ll see for themselves, Google has thousands of redirected domains. 
	<br />As long as your domain is related to your main site (and not to an unrelated site), it’s great!
	<br /><br />
	In my next email, I’ll talk about how Business Blogging Can Generate More Leads And Sales. All the best. 
	<br /><br />
	Let me know what you think.	
	<br /><br />
	<br /><br />
	Cheers,
	<br /><br />
	Ronnie
