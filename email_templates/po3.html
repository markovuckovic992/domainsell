	Hi {{ items.name }},

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">I hope you found
	my previous two emails helpful. I just wanted to let you know that
	your brand new domain is going to be ready for you soon.  </FONT>

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Have you decided
	how you are going to use your new domain? Here’s a few useful tips
	to help you get the most out of your new domain name. </FONT>

		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><U><B>Start

		companies with a blog attract 55% more visitors? A blog is a great
		way to tell your audience what you are doing. You can also talk
		about your offers. Fill it with engaging contents and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#1f4e79"><U><B>insert

		the new domain to host a new site</B></U></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
		This does not mean you have to scrap the existing one. Fill it with

		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><U><B>Forward
		your new domain to your current site</B></U></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
		If you think you do not have time for the above options, then this a
		great way to get started. Forwarding does not hold much juice for
		SEO but is good for branding. And anyone who says Google does not
		like forwarding, ask them to go to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><U>gooogle.com</U></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">
		(typo domain with three ‘o’s) and they’ll see for themselves,
		Google has thousands of redirected domains. As long as your domain
		is related to your main site (and not to an unrelated site), it’s
		great!</FONT></P>
